            Depression crept up inside Kenneth and spiralled him down. Once he was diagnosed, he received the medication he needed. He is now a person-in-recovery. 
          </p>    
          <p>
            On 27 Feb 2018, I attempted suicide.
          </p>
          <br/><p>Back in Aug 2017, I joined a new company after spending four wonderful years at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH). In the nation’s flagship hospital, I was given numerous opportunities to work with some of the brightest healthcare professionals, administrators and IT engineers in the industry. I have debated with a system specialist on the best way to improve our electronic incident reporting system, supported a committee of super senior doctors, and also sat beside an ICU pharmacist to review a medical error.</p>
          <br/><p>As a junior administrator, I learned a lot from the ways they systematically approach problems in operating a large and complex healthcare organisation. My director and manager gave me the autonomy to make the decisions I could at my level. In my fourth year, I got the chance to oversee the work of a junior executive and associate. I was fairly confident that I would be promoted if I stayed on for just a few more months. Despite these opportunities, I tendered my resignation.</p>
          <br/><p>As part of my handover , I also developed a syllabus for newbies as I gradually began to see the “big picture” and intentions behind my work. I told HR during the exit interview that I didn’t have anything against my bosses and colleagues. I simply wanted to advance my career in healthcare analytics, an area I was keen on.</p>    
          <br/><p>Fast forward to October 2017, the new portfolio was nowhere near the way I envisioned it to be. I was having difficulty adjusting to the new work environment and culture. It was micro-management at its best. For example, a simple spreadsheet report that normally took around ten minutes now took ten days due to multiple levels of clearance and still got stuck in my inbox because the manager didn’t have the confidence to make minor decisions. I also had a senior who taught me on how to send supposedly proper emails. That I should add “Regards,” on top of my signature footer, and respond with “Noted with thanks” whenever I received things from people in order to “sound more polite”. Once, he showed me examples of “Noted with thanks” from colleagues in the same department, and asked me how many I had sent so far.</p>
          <br/><p>SERIOUSLY, WHO CARES???</p>
          <br/><p>Face-to-face conversations with them failed to address the problems. I felt so suffocated that I resigned after three months without securing another job even though it was only a year to my wedding and BTO (build-to-order flat) key collection.</p>
          <br/><p>Then came the downward spiral.</p>
          <br/><p>I knew something was not right.</p>
          <br/><p>On 8 January 2018, I managed to get another position in the same industry, thinking that getting a job should help “cure” all these issues. However, the condition was full blown. I was absent more than 50% of the time. On the days when I managed to drag myself to work, I had difficulty concentrating, making decisions, and accomplishing the simplest of tasks. I noticed that my colleagues were completing their work much faster than I could. Mental fog made it very difficult for me to function.</p>
          <br/><p>On that fateful day, I texted my colleagues and loved ones that “I was feeling terrible” and to just “let me go”. I left my phone in my bedroom before wandering out of my home. Eventually, I climbed to the top of a multi-storey car park. I didn’t make the jump because I thought about all things which were waiting for me in the future: My wedding, the BTO and marriage. All coming in the later part of the year.</p>
          <br/><p>Back home, the police arrived. After taking my statement, the officer made the decision to call me an ambulance, and take me to the A&E department of IMH. I was diagnosed with depression. Fortunately, I didn’t have to be admitted. I resigned a few weeks later to focus on recovery.</p>
          <br/><p>One month after starting on Fluvoxamine, my sleep and energy improved significantly.</p>
          <br/><p>As I type this, I really hope to get back to the workforce with a strong sense of identity and confidence.</p>
          <br/><hr class=" border-black">
          <br/><p>Kenneth does quality and risk management in the healthcare industry. He is passionate about the topics of patient safety, quality improvement and healthcare analytics. In his free time, he likes long distance running, giving tuition, and spending time with his loved ones.</p>

            Here are seven practical suggestions to help you cope with COVID-19 if you have a mental health condition. 
          </p>
          <p><a href="https://www.health.gov.au/news/health-alerts/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-health-alert/what-you-need-to-know-about-coronavirus-covid-19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">COVID-19</a>&nbsp;was declared a global pandemic by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">World Health Organisation</a>&nbsp;on 11 March 2020.</p><br/><p>The new coronavirus is an infectious respiratory illness that is transmitted from person to person like the regular flu, but with a relatively low fatality rate compared to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sars/about/fs-sars.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">SARS,</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/faq.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">MERS</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_flu_pandemic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">H1N1</a>.</p><br/><p>Not much is known about COVID-19 at this point, which understandably causes fear and distress especially for us who have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/diseases-and-conditions/705/anxiety-disorder-or-just-anxious" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">anxiety related conditions</a>.</p><br/><p>Amidst the panic-buying (a.k.a. toilet paper hoarding) and frequent handwashing, we think this is a good time to hit the pause button and remind ourselves that resilience and hope (even humour!) can be just as contagious.</p><br/><p>We can rise above the chaos. Here are seven practical suggestions to empower ourselves:</p><br/><p>1. Write down what you can and cannot control. Fear and anxiety are natural responses to the unknown. Journal your thoughts and see what are the things you can change and what are those you can’t. For example, we can’t confront every person who doesn’t cover their mouths when they cough or sneeze, but we can walk away from them and keep a safe distance.</p><br/><p>2. Do not skip your medical appointments. Consult your doctor to see if your appointments can be rearranged; whether it’s possible to meet less frequently, or if there are other ways to have your sessions without meeting physically. Another way to minimise exposure each time you visit the hospital or clinic is to align your medical appointments on one day if possible, or have them less frequently according to your doctor’s advice.</p><br/><p>3. Ask if your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/singhealth-rolls-out-medicine-delivery-service-for-patients" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">medication can be delivered</a>&nbsp;instead of collected in person. Hospitals and polyclinics under&nbsp;<a href="https://www.singhealth.com.sg/patient-care/patient-visitor-info/medicine-delivery-service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Singhealth</a>&nbsp;offers this option. Some hospitals like Khoo Teck Puat hospital have a Medibox which functions like a parcel delivery locker that allows you to collect your medication refills at your own time, so you need not wait at the hospital pharmacy with the crowd.</p><br/><p>4. Limit your exposure to media and yes, that includes muting family chat groups that spread well-meaning but also fear-mongering fake news. Get your information from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">reputable sources</a>, be updated once or twice a day, and then fill the rest of your day with other meaningful activities.</p><br/><p>5. There are many of us who feel the need to wash our hands frequently which can trigger anxiety-driven compulsions and obsessive behaviour. If possible, we could use this as an opportunity to practise personal self-care in a mindful, compassionate way. Take a warm shower at the end of each day before bedtime. Be present in the moment and gently massage your fingers, joints as you wash your hands. Keeping clean and hygienic doesn’t have to be a chore. Other ways of caring for ourselves include having a balanced diet, some exercise and adequate sleep. Participate in relaxing activities like deep breathing or hobbies like gardening to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24798553" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">boost our immunity</a>.</p><br/><p>6. Social distancing does not mean social isolation. Reach out and check in regularly with people you care about. Make that phone call, or even video calls using Facetime and Skype. Or send a text or whatsapp. Be part of social media community groups. There are also groups that screen livestream events on Youtube and social media platforms. Gaming communities, Reddit are also other social ways of connecting with others. So even though we may all be keeping physical social distance, we can still connect with one another online in virtual spaces.</p><br/><p>7. There is online help such as counselling hotlines, chats, emails. We have a comprehensive&nbsp;<a href="https://thetapestryproject.sg/get-help-resources/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">directory here</a>. Remember, you don’t have to go at this alone. Help is available.</p><br/><p>As persons with mental health conditions, we are familiar with the battles in our minds. There aren’t any easy solutions, but we are much stronger than we realise. We have already overcome so much in our lives, and likewise, we shall also get through this, one day at a time. Rooting for us all!</p>

            <p class="opacity-60">A.M. is a person-in-recovery from depression and anxiety who is exercising patience with herself. Alongside treatment, she does things she loves. Recovery takes time. </p>

            <p>I’m A.M. and I have depression and anxiety disorder, or what I call, D+A. This has been my reality for the past three and a half years.</p><br/><p>The dysphoria started when I was 16. There was a ceaseless cloud of malaise and suicidal thoughts. Anxiety attacks were quotidian. I didn’t know what was wrong with me. Or rather, I didn’t want to admit that I had depression and anxiety disorder.</p><br/><p>I was averse to the idea of seeking help as I was reluctant to acknowledge my condition. I hated that it was a part of me. Thereafter, I started dealing with my condition through unhealthy ways, suffocated by everything around me — people, commitments, and school. I began isolating myself socially and retreated into a bubble. All I could remember was crying myself to sleep just to escape the melancholy, which grew worse with each night. The year 2016 was also the time of my ‘O’ Level examinations, which compelled me to supress every single emotional baggage and personal issue. This denial and self-negligence was the start of everything unpleasant.</p><br/><p>By Junior College, I could no longer deny that D+A was present in my life. So I reached out for proper treatment. Initially, it felt like everything was finally going in the right direction. But I was mistaken.</p><br/><p>My treatment entailed medications, counselling and therapies. Juxtaposed with the expectations of recovery, my condition got worse. Every visit to the psychiatrist and psychologist only resulted in higher doses of antidepressants which ironically made me feel worse. I was locked in a suicidal state and my short-term memory significantly degraded temporarily due to the use of anti-anxiety pills. It was a living hell. I was brought to the Emergency Room of IMH twice, missing out on school.</p><br/><p>By 2018, I was desperate to get better. I got increasingly frustrated and disappointed at myself for being this way. I thought being able to get help for it was all that there was to it. I lived each day hating the mess that I had become. I remembered walking around feeling the weight of the “grey cloud” on me everywhere I went. I remembered crying a lot. I questioned if this sort of life was worth the struggle.</p><br/><p>Ultimately, I just got tired and gave up on the pursuit of recovery. Nothing had worked, everything was bleak. At the time, I felt D+A was going to cling on to me for as long as I lived. So I stopped my medication, I stopped therapies and I stopped counselling sessions. I decided to just let it take over my life, until that one panic attack, the worst that I’ve had. I realised that I was, once again, back to square one.</p><br/><p>I decided to give treatment one last try and agreed with my psychiatrist to take a six-week break from school just to focus on myself, and on treatment. I remember feeling angry at myself for turning into this mess.</p><br/><p>With this epiphany, I started setting goals for myself, I slowly started to venture out doing things that I really love and enjoy. I eventually decided that I needed to be on a path where I would feel a sense of fulfilment and press that restart button which I’ve been searching for all along. Hence, I started on this journey to fight D+A head on.</p><br/><p>I left Junior College in the middle of my ‘A’ Level year, dropped important involvements in 2018 and really started doing things that I love. I decided to start studying things that would make my heart feel fulfilled and leisure activities that would make my heart beat in excitement. I started doing all these things alongside receiving treatment.</p><br/><p>I’m not saying that I’m totally off the hook with D+A. I still do have panic attacks in crowds when I’m alone. I still panic sometimes whenever I have to take the train alone during peak hours without blasting music into my ears and I still do panic when I enter a crowded cinema by myself. I am still on medication and have bouts of depression from time to time. However, life in general has never been better. I do feel a huge improvement in my condition and I’m not even sure if it’s the medications or if it is because I’ve decided to set D+A to be a separate thing from myself. Perhaps medication and therapy have their limits when it comes to me. Maybe all I needed was to take baby steps in doing the things that I love. Maybe all I needed was effort to put my focus into fighting against it instead of running away incessantly, expecting treatments to work on their own.</p><br/><p>Treatments are never going to work on their own without your will to fight against it. If no medication works for you yet, that’s okay. Everyone’s different, keep on searching for one that is right for you. No one medication is going to suit everyone the same. If no therapy works for you yet, it’s okay. Ask for an alternative. If there aren’t any yet, it’s okay. Just don’t let go. Keep holding on, keep on searching and you’ll eventually find your way up that mountain.</p><br/><p>When nothing works yet, it’s okay.</p>

              <p class="opacity-60">Support from family, friends and counsellors convinced Kurtle that suicide wasn’t the answer and set her on the life-long path to recovery from depression and psychosis. </p>
              <p>I used to cope with my troubles by self-harming. I have been self-harming since my teens when I was studying in Junior College. I later pursued my studies in Melbourne, where I fell ill. Hence, part of my recovery story happened in Melbourne, Australia, and then in Singapore, where I decided to come back for treatment.</p><br/><p>I was diagnosed with depression in March 2012, and was later diagnosed with psychosis in June that same year. I still remember how shocked and scared I was when I was diagnosed with psychosis. I thought it meant “psycho” and to me, “psycho” meant crazy. I felt that life was meaningless and that death was the only way out. My sleepless nights caused my concentration in school to be reduced greatly. Getting out of bed to school was a big hassle. However, I still managed to force myself to get up. However, during that period, I felt like a walking zombie, dragging my feet and staring into space during lectures. I was battling with managing with my fast-declining studies and the negative voices asking me to kill myself.</p><br/><p>I surrendered to the voices and attempted suicide a couple of times. But each time I did, there seemed to be another side of me that pulled me away from the brink and seek help. I once heard a low tone voice asking me to walk into fast moving traffic on a busy road. All it took was one step … suddenly, I ‘woke’ up and pulled myself back and called my school counsellor for help.</p><br/><p>I asked myself why I thought that death would solve all my problems. I asked myself why I always sought help and why I always woke up and pulled myself back. As fighting this monster was very taxing, soon, I decided to let go of the ‘rope’ and stop playing tug-of-war.</p><br/><p>Another time, when I was at the train station staring into blank space again, I heard the voice saying this: ‘’Jump off the tracks and you will end all your misery. You are a burden to everyone and you will definitely fail your examinations, so just jump off the tracks’’.</p><br/><p>It just kept repeating itself over and over again, with an increased intensity each time. Soon, I lost myself and walked towards the tracks. One step was all I needed.</p><br/><p>At this point, my phone ‘beeped’ and it was a message from my friend. It saved my life by ‘waking’ me up and I sought help.</p><br/><p>This time, I called my case manager in&nbsp;<a href="https://oyh.org.au/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Orygen Youth Health</a>, and after thorough assessment, I was admitted to the inpatient unit that day.</p><br/><p>I was so afraid to tell my parents that I had been admitted to the hospital and lied to them that I was in a three-day camp. Despite them suspecting that something was wrong, I still stuck to my lie and refused to pick up their calls.</p><br/><p>After much persuasion by the nurses, I called my cousin, who was a Permanent Resident in Melbourne where I was warded. I told her that I did not know what to do but felt really scared. I also told her not to leak a word to my parents.</p><br/><p>With a lot support from my cousin, I finally broke the news to my parents about one week into my admission. Being parents, they were worried and wanted to fly over. But I did not want them to see me in that state or be a further burden. I was just not thinking straight. Going against my will, they persevered and flew over to visit me. In retrospect, I am thankful they did.</p><br/><p>Besides getting support from my cousin and my ‘never say die’ parents, the staff (especially the occupational therapist) never gave up on me despite my reluctance to attend groups and my silence in groups (when I attended). This calming and friendly therapist made me break my silence eventually.</p><br/><p>Upon knowing that I like to do art stuff, she enhanced and worked on art sessions and allowed me to do arts and craft stuff as and when I requested it. That was when I soon opened myself up to other activities such as yoga.</p><br/><p>It was through that stay that I realised that I have support all around me.</p><br/><p>I had my friends who were willing to travel to visit me and teach me what I missed out in school. I had my cousin to whom I could tell anything. I had my parents who were always there for me despite me not seeing this fact at that point in time. And lastly, I had my medical team constantly encouraging me come out of my shell besides treating me medically.</p><br/><p>This was when I finally realised that there was still some light in my life and that it was worth living. I decided to fight my illness.</p><br/><p>I decided to fight it by moving forward with all the support I had from others.</p><br/><p>Of course, I faced lots of obstacles and even have had to make detours. For example, I had to defer one year of my university studies and even forgo my dream of becoming a vet. There were a lot of times when I really wanted to let go and give up. However, my case manager and occupational therapist in Singapore never gave up on me and constantly tried to make me comfortable in releasing my emotions and supporting me in all ways.</p><br/><p>For example, one form of my release of emotions involves texting it out. Upon knowing this, my occupational therapist willingly let her inbox (be it email or hand phone) be my ‘dustbin’, so I did not need to bottle up all my feelings and could express them to her.</p><br/><p>Another example that deeply impacted me was how my case manager would stay connected whether I was in Singapore or in Melbourne. When I was in Melbourne, she was always reachable via WhatsApp and even had meet up sessions with me via FaceTime.</p><br/><p>All these actions may seem tiny, but to me, they touched my heart and pushed me on.</p><br/><p>Besides the medical team, my family played an important and big part in my recovery process.</p><br/><p>They secretly researched my condition and tried their best to understand my emotions and condition fluctuations. They were always there to support me whenever I felt suicidal or had the urge to self-harm. They acted as a 24-hour medical staff and were always there for me.</p><br/><p>Lastly, my friends also played an important part in my recovery by constantly teaching me what I missed out in school. They also provided lots of support by checking in on me to make me feel that I was always supported, especially in Melbourne. Despite me dropping out of the veterinary science program, my peers never looked down upon me. Instead, whenever I felt inferior, they would tell me that we were still of the same status and no matter what, I would still be their friend. I even have a high school teacher, who is aware of my condition, who constantly supported me and made sense of things for me when I was ‘blinded’ by my own sadness or anger.</p><br/><p>I can confidently say that without my parents and without my medical staff, friends and teacher, I will not be where I am right now.</p><br/><p>I have gotten a Masters in Counselling, and am under an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/new-apprenticeship-scheme-2018-mental-health-peer-support-specialists" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">apprenticeship programme</a>&nbsp;to work towards being a full-time counsellor. It is not an easy process as it involves lots of changes, learning and adapting. But no matter where this illness takes me to, I believe that this is a learning journey.</p><br/><p>Completely free from negative thoughts and obstacles? I do not think this will happen but there is one thing I believe in – as long as I persevere, I can confidently say that I tried my best.</p><br/><p>Like this illness, my story does not stop here. I have accepted that it can be part of my life and I do not aim to be fully recovered. In fact, I am thankful that through the illness I had once-in-a-life time experiences that not all can go through. It also helps me grow as a person, bringing a positive experience with each negative experience.</p><br/><p>Thank you for taking time to read my recovery story.&nbsp;</p>

                <p class="opacity-60">Joy shares 7 ways you can support a loved one who has a mental health condition </p>
                <p>Being a mother, wife, daughter, daughter-in-law, employee — juggling these roles all at once is not uncommon in our society. However, it is when <a href="https://www.helpguide.org/articles/depression/depression-symptoms-and-warning-signs.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">depression</a> hits your immediate close ones, which in my case, my husband, that fulfilling these roles becomes even more apparent and daunting.</p><br/><p>How do you convey the illness to his family and your family when he can’t? How do you settle your children who are old enough for school but are yet too young to fully understand? In addition, you have a job to hold down. How do you talk about it, and whom should you tell? And while all these questions are running through your mind, what about the actual caring for the one&nbsp;who is unwell?</p><br/><p>I can fully appreciate the difficulties in grappling with&nbsp;this illness as I am also struggling to understand, even as I write this personal narrative, while sitting beside my sleeping husband in the hospital (not sure if he is really sleeping since a depressed person can’t really sleep restfully at all).</p><br/><p>Before you begin feeling overwhelmed, take a step back.</p><br/><p><strong>1.&nbsp;Take care of “you”</strong></p><br/><p>This is the focal point. Yourself! Take care of yourself. Never lose sight of that. The rest will follow.</p><br/><p><strong>2.&nbsp;Family</strong></p><br/><p>Get family support. Slowly and gently break the news. Step by step, at the appropriate time and place. You will find the support very comforting and forthcoming.</p><br/><p><strong>3. Work arrangements</strong></p><br/><p>You have to let your manager/supervisor know about the situation. If you are able to, provide plans and suggestions on how you intended to move forward in carrying our your work responsibilities. Perhaps take extended leave of absence, or have flexible hours etc.</p><br/><p>For me, I tell myself — if the workplace doesn’t allow it, I might have to quit or find another job that allows such arrangements.</p><br/><p>But before you assume I am rich, let me say that I am just a middle-class heartlander. I work to pay my bills, my children’s fees, provide allowances. My upbringing teaches me that saving for a rainy season is important.</p><br/><p><strong>4.&nbsp;Keep your children in the loop</strong></p><br/><p>Prepare your children especially if they are already of school-going age and have some level of&nbsp;reasoning. Just be honest and factual. You don’t have to provide them with the nitty gritty details. Believe it or not, the kids do understand. Somehow.</p><br/><p><picture><!--[if IE 9]><video style="display: none;"><![endif]--><source media="all and (min-width: 851px)" type="image/png" class=" lazyloading" data-srcset="/sites/default/files/styles/medium_275x275_1_1/public/inline-images/caregiving_globalgenes_0.png?itok=FUZ2PeBg 1x" srcset="/sites/default/files/styles/medium_275x275_1_1/public/inline-images/caregiving_globalgenes_0.png?itok=FUZ2PeBg 1x"><!--[if IE 9]></video><![endif]--><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="e04971df-ff70-4aec-866e-20532f68b4ef" data-responsive-image-style="responsive_medium_275x275_1_1" class="lazy lazyloaded " data-src="/sites/default/files/styles/medium_275x275_1_1/public/inline-images/caregiving_globalgenes_0.png?itok=FUZ2PeBg" src="/sites/default/files/styles/medium_275x275_1_1/public/inline-images/caregiving_globalgenes_0.png?itok=FUZ2PeBg" alt="7 Ways to Support a Loved One: Joy’s Story" typeof="foaf:Image"><noscript>

  </picture></p><br/><p><strong>5.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Observe</strong></p><br/><p>Be observant of:(1) your loved one’s condition and (2) the medication.</p><br/><p>Why his condition? Because he may not be in the best condition to express himself, therefore the doctor might ask for your feedback/observations&nbsp;as you are the person closest to him.</p><br/><p>Be aware though, and note that you don’t really have to ask the cared-for on his/her feelings — with depression, they are emotionally numb.</p><br/><p>Look out for physical signs — cuts on the hands or bruises anywhere. These&nbsp;may be self-inflicted wounds&nbsp;and can indicate dangerous suicidal tendencies.</p><br/><p>I had overlooked on the light and multiple cuts on my husband’s wrist seven years ago and thankfully (yes , thankfully), it was a non-lethal overdose which woke&nbsp;me up.</p><br/><p>Check medication. For obvious reasons, a depressed person may just overdose himself or not take any at all. See that the remaining dosages are indeed the correct amount.</p><br/><p><strong>6.&nbsp;Support from friends</strong></p><br/><p>Let a handful of close friends know. That way, you know that additional support is there and be more at ease because of that. Think about the first point —looking out for our own well-being.</p><br/><p><strong>7.&nbsp;Believe and have faith</strong></p><br/><p>Last but not least, keep your faith going. I am not a religious person but I believe in being spiritual. Be in touch with the surroundings and trust that there is a higher order in the universe which is beyond our understanding and capability.</p>

                  <p class="opacity-60">Maitreyi takes her experience as a caregiver for her father to create a safe space for caregivers to express their emotions while developing resilience and coping skills. </p>
                  <p><strong>Maitreyi’s efforts to create more support for caregivers’ mental health shows how cultural expectations can stand in the way of caring for those in need.</strong></p><br/><p><i>“Why would you get stressed if it’s your duty?”</i></p><br/><p>I have never had to devote my life to caring for someone who is chronically unwell. But those words struck a chord with me when Maitreyi Nigwekar shared them with me, an example of the response she gets when she is asked about the challenges of rallying support for caregivers and their mental health.&nbsp;</p><br/><p>Many of us at some point in our lives would have experienced the tug between the desire to care for our loved ones, and the stress that comes with that responsibility. Also the ensuing guilt over feeling frustrated at times.&nbsp;</p><br/><p>Dealing with those feelings at a personal level is challenging enough; it is even harder when social expectations come into play. As Maitreyi puts, “it is deeply ingrained in us to be there for the family at the cost of your health and your mental health.”&nbsp;</p><br/><p>Maitreyi, who started Adveka Foundation in Mumbai to provide support services to caregivers, is talking about India. But here in Singapore, I recognise the same values in my upbringing, where duty and expectations are deeply intertwined with love and kinship.&nbsp;</p><br/><p>And through her experience, I came to understand how damaging it can be when we let social expectations stand in the way of caring for caregivers.&nbsp;</p><br/><p><strong>A dream of care for caregivers</strong></p>

Her father struggled with alcoholism and had sought treatment for his addiction. While he received care and support, Maitreyi and her mother were left to cope on their own, even as they had to care for him. It was a situation with “a lot of suffering and pain, and isolation”, she shares.</p><br/><p>Trained in counselling psychology, Maitreyi eventually realised that many caregivers were in the same position, and started Adveka to support their mental well-being. The foundation works with caregivers identified by other NGOs and hospitals to offer individual counselling and support group sessions at a nominal fee.&nbsp;</p><br/><p>Through these sessions, caregivers find a safe space to express their feelings of sadness, frustration, disappointment and anger without being judged. At the same time, they develop resilience and coping skills.</p><br/><p>In the early days of setting up the foundation, Maitreyi had sought help with legal matters. “I remember I met one lawyer advocate. We had a conversation [about Adveka’s mission].”</p><br/><p>“Throughout the conversation, I could see him getting visibly confused. And as I finished, he looked at me and he was like, ‘Why would you want to have an organisation that does this? This is your duty [as a caregiver], this is what you are supposed to be doing. Why would you get stressed if it’s your duty?’”</p><br/><p>“I had to explain to him that even if it is a sense of duty, we all have mental health, and it can get affected because of all the caregiving duties.”</p><br/><p>In India, attitudes like the lawyer’s are “extremely, extremely ingrained in our systems”, says Maitreyi. “So it gets hard when we are looking at caregiving and caregivers, when you have grown up in that culture, to then say, ‘Oh I am feeling depressive symptoms because I am a caregiver for my father who now has dementia. Or my child who has a disability.’”</p><br/><p>Not only does Maitreyi have to convince potential donors that caregiver support is worth funding, she has to convince caregivers that it is okay to seek help for themselves. “They think, ‘If I have my morning coffee, then I’m being selfish.’”</p><br/><p><img alt="" class="center" src="https://blog.ourbetterworld.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Adveka-feature-1-1024x678.jpg" srcset="https://blog.ourbetterworld.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Adveka-feature-1-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://blog.ourbetterworld.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Adveka-feature-1-300x199.jpg 300w, https://blog.ourbetterworld.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Adveka-feature-1-768x509.jpg 768w" width="1024" height="678"></p><br/><p>Since 2015, Adveka has supported more than 4,000 caregivers. It has also worked with other NGOs such as Manav Foundation, to develop capacity to support caregivers. But amid COVID-19, Adveka has had to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/advekafoundation/photos/a.723219291143743/2051922048273454/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">pause operations</a>&nbsp;due to a lack of funding, as donors channel their money towards COVID-19 relief. Lockdowns have also not been conducive for support sessions, especially for low-income families without stable Internet access at home.&nbsp;</p><br/><p>For now, Maitreyi is conducting one-on-one counselling sessions for caregivers, while figuring out the best way to get Adveka back on track. “It’s very difficult to convince donors because…it’s ‘Why should I fund caregivers, when I can fund [care for] the illness itself?’” says Maitreyi.&nbsp;</p><br/><p><img alt="" class="align-center"  src="https://blog.ourbetterworld.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Rotary-Sanskardham-Academy-Goregaon-Primary-Caregivers-of-children-with-Special-Needs-768x1024.jpg" srcset="https://blog.ourbetterworld.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Rotary-Sanskardham-Academy-Goregaon-Primary-Caregivers-of-children-with-Special-Needs-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://blog.ourbetterworld.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Rotary-Sanskardham-Academy-Goregaon-Primary-Caregivers-of-children-with-Special-Needs-225x300.jpg 225w, https://blog.ourbetterworld.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Rotary-Sanskardham-Academy-Goregaon-Primary-Caregivers-of-children-with-Special-Needs.jpg 960w" width="346" height="461"></p><br/><p>Yet, as she points out, “if [caregivers] don’t take care of themselves, they can’t care for their recipients the best way they want to.”</p><br/><p>Strong families are often held up as the bedrock of societies across Asia, and many of us hold these ties dear. But it is also important to examine our long-held beliefs to make space for new cultural norms — ones that do not hold back people from seeking help when they need it.&nbsp;</p><br/><p>Supporting the work of organisations like Adveka can give caregivers the tools to better care for their loved ones, and in turn, keep those all-important bonds alive.&nbsp;</p>
